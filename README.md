# Execution OS

Execution OS is a minimal operating system for turning decisions into real outcomes.

This repository is not a framework.
It is not a theory.
It is an execution protocol.

---

## What this is

Execution OS is a simple, repeatable loop:

Decision → Execution → Artifact → Review

No abstractions.
No planning without delivery.
No execution without output.

If something does not produce a real artifact, it does not exist.

---

## Core principles

- Execution is the unit of progress
- Artifacts validate thinking
- Reality is the only feedback loop
- Systems grow only through shipped work

Architecture without delivery is discarded.

---

## How it works

Each execution cycle follows the same structure:

1. A decision is fixed
2. Execution is initiated
3. A tangible artifact is produced
4. The process is logged
5. Results are reviewed
6. The next cycle begins

Same structure.
Same rules.
Different outcomes.

## Status

This system is operational.

It evolves only through action.
